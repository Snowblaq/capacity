<!-- This is Question two -->
<p>First off, i really dont know where to start from about that story. i grew up without the love or care of a father. for as long as i can remember i had just my mum. through thick and thin she was there. Always there. looking out for me, rooting for me, making sure i was comfortable. my number one fan. she never made me feel like i needed a dad to make my life any perfect or any better. but i had a dad.. who was married to my mother till her demise. the thing was.... he was never there. which had to make my mum the breadwinner, the soul provider, even when he had a very good job at a renowned and reputable company. funny right? my mum didnâ€™t mind. she stayed cause of us she would say. she paid every bill we had pending. often times she takes us over to visit my dad at the state where he works. Well as you guessed this trip was fully funded by her truly. Even when we got there he rarely cared so she would never let us starve that was most definitely not an option. She was the hero i knew, Role model, super woman and most importantly my Everything Everything. </p>
